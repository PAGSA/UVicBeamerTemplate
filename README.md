# UVicBeamerTemplate

This repository contains a custom UVic beamer template for creating LATEX slides.

The styling and configuration is done in the uvic-beamer/uvic-header.tex file so the uvic-beamer directory is all you need to get started.
I also included a couple example slides showing how to setup the template
